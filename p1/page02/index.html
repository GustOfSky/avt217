	<h1>Woke up 7/14/2023 Part 1</h1>
	<h2>Yinyu Gustafson</h2>
	<p>Eyo, so basically, girl is trapped in a cage at her house cuz supposedly she’s got powers, when she gets super mad, everything in the house will start to shake. It’s a big cage, but one day, she’s either let out or finds a way out and then ends up using a machine that lets her fly away, one only she can control. She ends up meeting a bunch of different people wearing cosplay of different movies and T.V. shows, I only say this because I vividly remember a Dorothy cosplay. She ends up returning and at some point, she’s cornered by a bunch of dudes who want to throw her in an ice bath??? Not out of malicious intent, more like brotherly obnoxiousness??? But then her parents realize she’s back and want to re-cage her, so she runs away again, only this time, upon trying to go back to the place she was before going back home, she learns that she can’t go back because her going to the place in the first place was because she had been in a coma/death-like state and the reason she could even travel as far as she did was because she had been in a coma/knocked out. The place she went to before, super bright and colorful, amusement park-like, all the people are also super bright and colorful, bright hair and whatnot, everyone was basically waiting for her, like she was meant to be there??? Yk, until she decided she needed to go back. Someone had light purple hair that was swirled up, sort of like frosting on a <a href ="../page03/index.html">cupcake</a>.</p>
