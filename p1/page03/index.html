	<p>Girl turns into cat after being told that I left my watch at her place, but she couldnâ€™t find it, so she ended up getting an entirely new watch and I saw her become human and wtf was happening, but anyway, I told her I never left my watch at her place and showed her and then she asked me not to tell anyone about seeing her become a cat and then she left out the <a href ="../page04/index.html">window</a> or something and then I somehow was at a hotel with my parents, yellow lighting, sort of? Round, big open space, black wall detailing, but more like, black marble column wall thingies.</p>
