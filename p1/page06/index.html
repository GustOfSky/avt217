	<p>People can turn into different animals and this girl turns into a black <a href ="../page07/index.html">dragon</a> and tries to take our Ferris wheel cart away that we were trying to enchant in order to practice magic without others hearing, which we did by singing and were making an orb of privacy sort of in the image of the protection orb from Barbie in the Diamond Castle when they’re defeating Lydia by singing and playing the Muses’ instruments. One dude is a prince who she’s trying to kidnap for her master, I’m pretty sure against her will. I ended up burying her and everyone else in the ground, with only their heads poking up, and was able to achieve this due to the majority of them being knocked out or close to being completely unconscious. </p>
