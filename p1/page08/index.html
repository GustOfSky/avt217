	<p>Bad dream about homework, wanted to turn something in so I could go hang out with friends, go to the movies or something, but it turned out I needed to <a href ="../page09/index.html">somehow</a> get other classmates’ very specific opinions on the group project, which no one worked on. So I tried to focus on other work instead, but the majority of it relied on the group project. </p>
