	<p>Ah, <a href ="../page06/index.html">horror</a> dream, basically like the Seventeen video I watched where everyone needed to get a key to escape, but I was quickly caught by the mask guy and was like, bro, just lemme give up and he just let me walk back towards where “dead” people were to stay after being caught. But then it was raining and all my stuff was getting drenched because the ceiling was severely leaking, but then Rachel came and got my stuff and all of a sudden she was there too. Also, Dad and I went on a trip to Tokyo because of some sale happening at a Target there . . . Honestly, idek. I just remember most of the people at the Target weren’t Japanese and we were trying to find a specific children’s book. Something to do with peaches, maybe? I think the character’s name was Peaches?</p>
