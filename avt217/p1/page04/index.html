	<h1>Woke up 7/15/2023</h1>
	<h2>Yinyu Gustafson</h2>
	<p>In some sort of facility competing with other kids, but prior, somehow gained powers and was able to fly? Was hiding ability from everyone else, but mom knew. Ended up capturing some mythical creature who ended up bonding with me and helped destroy everyone trying to harm me and others. Mythical creature was going to hurt other mythical creatures, but managed to find a way to get those mythical creatures to help destroy the researchers instead. Had to connect a final moon-looking orb in order to connect to the<a href ="../page05/index.html">mythical</a>creature. Was like a dragon? Some other girl nudge the final orb into place. Among Us somehow got incorporated??? Was at some point gonna go grocery shopping with mom and was wearing a white short-sleeve shirt underneath a spaghetti strap dress that reached ankles or under knees and was black with small florals. Was trying to brush hair, and was somehow having the best hair day ever, no matter the direction, hair looked good, but then got fringe out of nowhere??? Also, some girl couldn’t stay the night or whatever because her father was an obnoxious prick who was over controlling, but her mom just laughed off whatever her father was saying to his daughter, who had Teen Titans Raven vibes. The mom said she’d talk to him and let the girl stay the night. I’m half positive I flew around other places??? Like, maybe a city? Not sure, but mom and dad took me flying pretty well, but told me not to tell anyone else, fair enough.</p>
