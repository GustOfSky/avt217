		<h1>Yinyu's 20 Questions</h1>
		<b><p>Question 1: What's the most overrated thing?</p></b>
			<p>Apple products.</p>
		<b><p>Question 2: What's your favorite movie?</p></b>
			<p>Monty Python and the Holy Grail.</p>
		<b><p>Quesiton 3: Dream vacation spot?</p></b>
			<p>My room. For somewhere outside of the U.S., perhaps a Victorian castle in Europe. Or any fanciful castle in Europe. Or mayhaps a food market in Asia.</p>
		<b><p>Question 4: Are you a warm weather or cold weather person?</p></b>
			<p>If I absolutely had to choose, cold weather, because you can always add more layers. There comes a point where you can't just peel of your own skin, muscles, etc.</p>
		<b><p>Question 5: Favorite type of cuisine?</p></b>
			<p>My tongue has never been more blessed than the times I was able to experience authentic Chinese food. The Americanized stuff is pretty good too, though, so Chinese for the win. Not that I'm biased or anything.</p>
		<b><p>Question 6: Favorite animal?</p></b>
			<p>Cats. Cats are fantastic.</p>
		<b><p>Question 7: Favorite font?</p></b>
			<p>Times New Roman, due to its easy readability.</p>
		<b><p>Question 8: If money wasn't an issue, what is the first item you would get that isn't an essential item?</p></b>
			<p>A tank. Cuz why not.</p>
		<b><p>Question 9: Dog or cat person?</p></b>
			<p>Cat person all the way.</p>
		<b><p>Question 10: What is your favorite way to relax or detox?</p></b>
			<p>Sleep. I love sleeping. Only food shares the same type of joy as sleep in my life.</p>
		<b><p>Question 11: What is a TV show you currently recommend</p></b>
			<p>BBC Sherlock or &ldquo;My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!&rdquo; or &ldquo;One Punch Man.&rdquo;</p>
		<b><p>Question 12: Favorite season?</p></b>
			<p>Fall supremacy, due to leaves falling, Halloween, and Thanksgiving.</p>
		<b><p>Question 13: What did you do for winter break?</p></b>
			<p>I regrettably decide to work at Marshalls. Coworkers, fantastic, customers, not so much. I also visited family and annoyed my cat.</p>
		<b><p>Question 14: What are your pet peeves?</p></b>
			<p>If I were to state all of my pet peeves, my list may never end, so I will list only five.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>People who are rude to random strangers with no provocation or reason. Or, you know, rude people in general.</li>
			<li>Bugs anywhere but outside.</li>
			<li>Messy foods that result in my fingers and/or face becoming messy.</li>
			<li>Slow internet, because I'm a basic Gen Z child with an unhealthy obsession with the internet.</li>
			<li>Intrusion of my personal space.</li>
		</ul>
		<b><p>Question 15: What's your favorite game to play?</p></b>
			<p>Potentially Cards Against Humanity or any game that can be played with a group and quickly devolve into a chaotic mess.</p>
		<b><p>Question 16: What is your favorite book genre?</p></b>
			<p>Fantasy-Adventure.</p>
		<b><p>Question 17: What is your favorite song by an artist you don't generally listen to?</p></b>
			<p>&ldquo;Eyes, Nose, Lips&rdquo; by Taeyang, &ldquo;Lullabye for a Stormy Night&rdquo; by Vienna Teng, &ldquo;Still Love You&rdquo; by Lee Hong Gi, Yoo Hwe Seung, or &ldquo;Falling Blossoms&rdquo; by Kim Heechul and Min Kyunghoon.</p>
		<b><p>Question 18: Excluding any actual military figures from history, if you had a zombie army who would you make the general and why?</p></b>
			<p>After much deliberation, I chose Ainz Ooal Gown from Overlord because he's technically dead and has necromancy powers which may help in regards to controlling a zombie army. (Sebastian from Black Butler was a close second.)</p>
		<b><p>Question 19: What is your food hot take?</p></b>
			<p>Before anyone says anything, don't knock it till you try it, but dipping plain cheese pizza in strawberry yogurt has been the epitome of my college dining hall life.</p>
